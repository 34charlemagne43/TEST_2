                        If you ever leave me, baby <br>
                    Leave some morphine at my door<br>
                    'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication<br>
                    To realize what we used to have<br>
                    We don't have it anymore<br>
                    There's no religion that could save me<br>
                    No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh<br>
                    So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'<br>
                    To keep you by my side<br>
                    To keep you from walkin' out the door<br>

                    'Cause there'll be no sunlight<br>
                    If I lose you, baby<br>
                    There'll be no clear skies<br>
                    If I lose you, baby<br>
                    Just like the clouds<br>
                    My eyes will do the same if you walk away<br>
                    Every day, it'll rain<br>
                    Rain, rain<br>

                    I'll never be your mother's favorite<br>
                    Your daddy can't even look me in the eye<br>
                    Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing<br>
                    Saying, "There goes my little girl<br>
                    Walking with that troublesome guy"<br>
                    But they're just afraid of something they can't understand<br>
                    Ooh, but, little darling, watch me change their minds<br>
                    Yeah, for you, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try<br>

                    And pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleedin'<br>
                    If that'll make you mine<br>

                    'Cause there'll be no sunlight<br>
                    If I lose you, baby<br>
                    There'll be no clear skies<br>
                    If I lose you, baby<br>
                    Just like the clouds<br>
                    My eyes will do the same if you walk away<br>
                    Every day, it'll rain<br>
                    Rain, rain<br>

                    Ooh, don't you say (Don't you say)<br>
                    Goodbye (Goodbye)<br>
                    Don't you say (Don't you say)<br>
                    Goodbye (Goodbye)<br>

                    I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleedin'<br>
                    If that'll make it right<br>

                    'Cause there'll be no sunlight<br>
                    If I lose you, baby<br>
                    And there'll be no clear skies<br>
                    If I lose you, baby<br>
                    And just like the clouds<br>
                    My eyes will do the same if you walk away<br>
                    Every day, it'll rain<br>
                    Rain, rain
